= Configuration

== Maven

To include <<ref:FCSSimpleEndpoint>> these are the dependencies:

[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>eu.clarin.sru.fcs</groupId>
    <artifactId>fcs-simple-endpoint</artifactId>
    <version>1.3.0</version>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>javax.servlet</groupId>
    <artifactId>servlet-api</artifactId>
    <version>2.5</version>
    <type>jar</type>
    <scope>provided</scope>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

The version is currently `1.4-SNAPSHOT` if you want and enable the Clarin snapshots repository.


== Endpoint

To enable SRU 2.0 which is required for FCS 2.0 functionality you need to provide the following 
initialization parameters to the servlet context:

[source,xml]
----
<init-param>
    <param-name>eu.clarin.sru.server.sruSupportedVersionMax</param-name>
    <param-value>2.0</param-value>
</init-param>
<init-param>
    <param-name>eu.clarin.sru.server.legacyNamespaceMode</param-name>
    <param-value>loc</param-value>
</init-param>
----

The endpoint configurations consists of the already mentionend context (`ServletContext`), a config (`SRUServerConfig`) and if you want further query parsers (`SRUQueryParserRegistry.Builder`). Also additional parameters gathered from servlet configuration and the servlet context are available.


== EndpointDescriptionParser

You probably start out using the provided `EndpointdescriptionParser`. It will parse and make available what is required and also do some sanity checkning.

* `Capabilities`, _basic search_ capability is required and _advanced search_ is available for FCS 2.0, checks that any given capability is encoded as a proper URI and that the IDs are unique.
* Supported Data views, checks  that `<SupportedDataView>` elements have:
+
--
** a proper `@id` attribute and that the value is unique. 
** a `@delivery-policy` attribute, e.g. `DeliveryPolicy.SEND_BY_DEFAULT`, `DeliveryPolicy.NEED_TO_REQUEST`.
** a child text node with a MIME-type as its content, e.g. for _basics search (hits)_: `application/x-clarin-fcs-hits+xml` and for _advanced search_: `application/x-clarin-fcs-adv+xml`
--
+
Sample: `<SupportedDataView id="adv" delivery-policy="send-by-default">application/x-clarin-fcs-adv+xml</SupportedDataView>`

Makes sure capabilities and declared dataviews actually match otherwise it will warn you.

* Supported Layers, checks that `<SupportedLayer>` elements have:

** a proper `@id` attribute and that the value is unique.
** a proper `@result-id` attribute and that is is encoded as a proper URI, and that the child text node is "text", "lemma", "pos", "orth", "norm", "phonetic", or other value starting with "x-".
** if a `@alt-value-info-uri` attribute that is encoded as proper URI, e.g. tag description
** if _advanced search_ is given in capabilities that it is also available.

* Resources, checks that some resources are actually defined, and have:

** a proper `@xml:lang` attribute on its `<Description>` elelement.
** a child `<LandingPageURI>` element
** a child `<Language>` element and that is must use ISO-639-3 three letter language codes


== Translation library

For the current version of the translation library a mapping for <<ref:UD-POS,UD-17>> to your used word classes for the word class layer is needed. It currently also does <<ref:SAMPA,X-SAMPA>> conversion for the phonetic layer. The mappings are specified in one configuration file, an XML document. This will mostly be 1-to-1, but might require lossy translation either way. To guide you in this we walk through configuration and mapping examples from the reference implemetations.


=== Part-of-Speech (PoS)

The PoS translation configuration is expressed in a TranslationTable element with the attributes `@fromResourceLayer`, `@toResourceLayer` and `@translationType`:

[source,xml]
----
<!-- ... -->
<TranslationTable fromResourceLayer="FCSAggregator/PoS" toResourceLayer="Korp/PoS" translationType="replaceWhole">
<!-- ... -->
----

`@translationType` is currently a closed set of two values, but could be extended by any definition on how to replace something in to. The values are _replaceWhole_ and _replaceSegments_, but _replaceSegments_ require further defintions of trellis segment translations which will not be 
addressed by this tutorial.

The values of `@fromResourceLayer` and `@toResourceLayer` only depends on these being declared 
by `<ResourceLayer>` elements under `/<AnnotationTranslation>/<Resources>`:

[source,xml]
----
<ResourceLayer resource="FCSAggregator" layer="phonetic" formalism="X-SAMPA" />
----

The attributes of `<ResourceLayer>` are `@resource`, `@layer` and `@formalism`. The value of `@layer` is (most easily) the identifier which is used for the layer in the FCS 2.0 specification. `@formalism` is (most easily) the namespace value prefix or an URI. E.g. for PoS this can be _SUC-PoS_ for the 
already mentionend SUC PoS tagset, _CGN_ or _UD-17_. These tag sets often also includes morphosyntactic descriptions _MSD_ in its original form, but since MSD is not part of the FCS 2.0 specification we are only dealing with the PoS tags here.

Going from UD-17's _VERB_ tag to Stockholm Ume√• Corpus (SUC) Part-of-Speech you get two tags 
VB and PC:

[source,xml]
----
      <Pair from="VERB"   to="VB" />
      <Pair from="VERB"   to="PC" />
----

Adding the translation of the UD-17 AUX tag which gives VB in SUC-PoS too, but this is a 1-to-1 translation this way.

[source,xml]
----
      <Pair from="AUX"    to="VB" />
----

As you can see from this the precision is varying and could become too bad to be useful going both ways from the <<ref:FCSAggregator>> to the endpoint and then back. For this you can use the available alerting methods given in the FCS 2.0 specification.

With non-1-to-1 translations you need to know how alternatives are expressed in the endpoints query language. This is where the not yet available conversion library would use the translation library adding rule-based knowledge on how to translate to e.g. CQP `[pos = "VB" | pos = "PC"]`.
