== List of extra request parameters

The following extra request parameters are used in CLARIN-FCS. The column _SRU operations_ lists the SRU operation, for which this extra request parameter is to be used. Clients `MUST NOT` use the parameter for an operation that is not listed in this column. However, if a Client sends an invalid parameter, an Endpoint `SHOULD` issue a fatal diagnostic "Unsupported Parameter" (`info:srw/diagnostic/1/8`) and stop processing the request. Alternatively, an Endpoint `MAY` silently ignore the invalid parameter.

|Parameter Name
|SRU operations
|Allowed values
|Description

|x-fcs-endpoint-description
|explain
|`true`; all other values are reserved and `MUST` not be used by Clients
|If the parameter is given (with the value `true`), the Endpoint `MUST` include an Endpoint Description in the `<sru:extraResponseData>` element of the _explain_ response.

|x-fcs-context
|searchRetrieve
|A comma-separated list of persistent identifiers
|The Endpoint `MUST` restrict the search to the resources identified by the persistent identifiers.

|x-fcs-dataviews
|searchRetrieve
|A comma-separated list of Data View identifiers
|The Endpoint `SHOULD` include the additional _need-to-request_ type Data Views in the response.

|x-fcs-rewrites-allowed
|searchRetrieve
|`true`; all other values are reserved and `MUST` not be used by Clients. Clients `MUST` only use this parameter when performing an Advanced Search request.
|If the parameter is given (with the value `true`), the Endpoint `MAY` rewrite the query to a simpler query to allow for more recall.
|===

For SRU 2.0 the request parameter `queryType` `MUST` be used unless the query language is CQL which is the default. For using FCS-QL the value `MUST` be _fcs_.


== List of diagnostics

Apart from the SRU diagnostics defined in <<ref:OASIS-SRU12,OASIS-SRU12, Appendix C>> and <<ref:LOC-DIAG>>, the following diagnostics are used in CLARIN-FCS. The column "Details Format" specifies what `SHOULD` be returned in the details field. If this column is blank, the format is "undefined" and the Endpoint `MAY` return whatever it feels appropriate, including nothing. The column "Impact" specifies, if the endpoint should continue ("non-fatal") or should stop ("fatal") processing.

|Persistent identifier passed by the Client for restricting the search is invalid.
|The offending persistent identifier.
|non-fatal
|If more than one invalid persistent identifiers were submitted by the Client, the Endpoint `MUST` generate a separate diagnostic for each invalid persistent identifier.

|Resource set too large. Query context automatically adjusted.
|The persistent identifier of the resource to which the query context was adjusted.
|non-fatal
|If an Endpoint limited the query context to more than one resource, it `MUST` generate a separate diagnostic for each resource to which the query context was adjusted.

|Detailed error message why the query could not be parsed.

|Query too complex. Cannot perform Query.
|Details why could not be performed, e.g. unsupported layer or unsupported combination of operators.

|http://clarin.eu/fcs/diagnostic/12
|Query was rewritten.
|Details how the query was rewritten.
