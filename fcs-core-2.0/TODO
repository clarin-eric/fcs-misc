- [ ] formatting does not seem always consistent
  - e.g. `fcs-to-sru-cql-binding.adoc`: `value is _fcs_` instead of using backticks
- [ ] missing links/pages in original spec to TREC
  - https://trac.clarin.eu/wiki/Taskforces/FCS/FCS%20POS%20tag%20set
- [ ] move all TREC specs to ASCIIDoc + update references in specs
- [x] consistent example URLs in SRU/CQL `fcs-to-sru-cql-binding.adoc`
- [x] `the Client must issue`, `MUST`? in `fcs-to-sru-cql-binding.adoc`
