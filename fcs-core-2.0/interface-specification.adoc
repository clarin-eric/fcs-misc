= CLARIN-FCS Interface Specification

The CLARIN-FCS Interface Specification defines a set of capabilities, an extensible result format and a set of required operations. CLARIN-FCS is built on the SRU/CQL standard and additional functionality required for CLARIN-FCS is added through SRU/CQL's extension mechanisms.

Specifically, the CLARIN-FCS Interface Specification consists of two parts, a set of formats, and a transport protocol. The _Endpoint_ component is a software component that acts as a bridge between a _Client_ and a _Search Engine_ and passes the requests sent by the _Client_ to the _Search Engine_. The _Search Engine_ is a custom software component that allows the search of language resources in a Repository. The _Endpoint_ implements the _Transport Protocol_ and acts as a mediator between the CLARIN-FCS specific formats and the idiosyncrasies of _Search Engines_ of the individual Repositories. The following figure illustrates the overall architecture.

.CLARIN-FCS Overall Architecture
image::fcs-architecture.png[CLARIN-FCS Overall Architecture]

In general, the work flow in CLARIN-FCS is as follows: a Client submits a query to an Endpoint; the Endpoint translates the query from CQL or FCS-QL to the query dialect used by the Search Engine and submits the translated query to the Search Engine; the Search Engine processes the query and generates a result set, i.e. it compiles a set of hits that match the search criterion; the Endpoint then translates the results from the Search Engine-specific result set format to the CLARIN-FCS result format and sends them to the Client.


== Discovery

The _Discovery_ step allows a Client to gather information about an Endpoint, in particular which capabilities are supported or which resources are available for searching.


=== Capabilities

A _Capability_ defines a certain feature set that is part of CLARIN-FCS, e.g. what kind of queries are supported. Each Endpoint implements some (or all) of these Capabilities. The Endpoint will announce the capabilities it provides to allow a Client to auto-tune itself (see section <<Endpoint Description>>). Each Capability is identified by a _Capability Identifier_, which uses the URI syntax. The following Capabilities are defined in CLARIN-FCS:

|===

Endpoints `MUST` implement the _Basic Search_ Capability. Endpoints `MUST NOT` invent custom Capability Identifiers and `MUST` only use the values defined above.


=== Endpoint Description

Endpoints need to provide information about their capabilities to support auto-configuration of Clients. The _Endpoint Description_ mechanism provides the necessary facility to provide this information to the Clients. Endpoints `MUST` encode their capabilities using an XML format and embed this information into the SRU/CQL protocol as described in section <<Operation _explain_,Operation "explain">>. The XML fragment generated by the Endpoint for the Endpoint Description `MUST` be valid according to the XML schema link:attachments/Endpoint-Description.xsd["Endpoint-Description.xsd"].

The XML fragment for _Endpoint Description_ is encoded as an `<ed:EndpointDescription>` element that contains the following attributes and children:

* one `@version` attribute (`REQUIRED`) on the `<ed:EndpointDescription>` element
+
The value of the `@version` attribute `MUST` be `2`.

* one `<ed:Capabilities>` element (`REQUIRED`) that contains one or more `<ed:Capability>` elements
+
The content of the `<ed:Capability>` element is a Capability Identifier that indicates the capabilities that are supported by the Endpoint. For valid values for the Capability Identifier, see section <<Capabilities>>. This list `MUST NOT` include duplicate values.

* one `<ed:SupportedDataViews>` element (`REQUIRED`)
+
A list of Data Views that are supported by this Endpoint. This list is composed of one or more <ed:SupportedDataView> elements. The content of a `<ed:SupportedDataView>` `MUST` be the MIME type of a supported Data View, e.g. `application/x-clarin-fcs-hits+xml`. Each `<ed:SupportedDataView>` element `MUST` carry an `@id` and a `@delivery-policy` attribute. The value of the `@id` attribute is later used in the <ed:Resource> element to indicate which Data View is supported by a resource (see below). Endpoints `SHOULD` use the recommended short identifier for the Data View. The `@delivery-policy` indicates, the Endpoint's delivery policy, for that Data View. Valid values are `send-by-default` for the _send-by-default_ and `need-to-request` for the _need-to-request_ delivery policy.
+
This list `MUST NOT` include duplicate entries, i.e. no MIME type must appear more than once.
+
The value of the `@id` attribute `MUST NOT` contain the characters `,` (comma) or `;` (semicolon) 

* one `<ed:SupportedLayers>` element (`REQUIRED` if Endpoint supports _Advanced Search_ capability)
+
A list of Layers that are generally supported by this Endpoint. This list is composed of one or more `<ed:SupportedLayer>` elements. The content of a `<ed:SupportedLayer>` `MUST` be the identifier of a Layer (see section <<Layers>>), e.g. orth. Each `<ed:SupportedLayer>` element `MUST` carry an `@id` and a @result-id attribute. The value of the `@id` attribute is later used in the <ed:Resource> element to indicate, which Data View is supported by a resource (see below). The `@result-id` attribute is used in the Advanced Data View (see section <<Advanced (ADV), Advanced Data View>>). Each `<ed:SupportedLayer>` element `MAY` carry an optional `@qualifier` attribute. It is used as a qualifier in a FCS-QL search term in to address this specific layer.
+
This list `MUST NOT` include duplicate entries, i.e. no Layer with the same `@result-id` MIME type must appear more than once.
+
The value of the `@id` or `@result-id` attribute `MUST NOT` contain the characters `,` (comma) or `;` (semicolon) The value of the `@qualifier` attribute `MUST NOT` contain characters other than `a`-`z`,`A`-`Z`,`0`-`9` and `-` (hyphen), and the first character MUST be one of `a`-`z` or `A`-`Z`. The `<ed:SupportedLayer>` element `MAY` carry an `@alt-value-info` and `@alt-value-info-uri` attribute; `@alt-value-info` `SHOULD` contain a short description about the layer, e.g. the original tag set used; `@alt-value-info-uri` `MUST` contain a well-formed URI and `SHOULD` point to a web site with further information, e.g. about the original tag set and how the translation to FCS is done. Client, e.g. the Aggregator, can display this information together with the search result.

* one `<ed:Resources>` element (`REQUIRED`)
+
A list of (top-level) resources that are available, i.e. searchable, at the Endpoint. The `<ed:Resources>` element contains one or more `<ed:Resource>` elements (see below). The Endpoint `MUST` declare at least one (top-level) resource.

The `<ed:Resource>` element contains a basic description of a resource that is available at the Endpoint. A resource is a searchable entity, e.g. a single corpus. The `<ed:Resource>` has a mandatory `@pid` attribute that contains persistent identifier of the resource. This value `MUST` be the same as the _MdSelfLink_ of the CMDI record describing the resource. The `<ed:Resource>` element contains the following children:

* one or more `<ed:Title>` elements (`REQUIRED`)
+
A human readable title for the resource. A `REQUIRED` `@xml:lang` attribute indicates the language of the title. An English version of the title is `REQUIRED`. The list of titles `MUST NOT` contain duplicate entries for the same language.

* zero or more `<ed:Description>` elements (`OPTIONAL`)
+
An optional human-readable description of the resource. It `SHOULD` be at most one sentence. A `REQUIRED` `@xml:lang` attribute indicates the language of the description. If supplied, an English version of the description is `REQUIRED`. The list of descriptions `MUST NOT` contain duplicate entries for the same language.

* zero or one `<ed:LandingPageURI>` element (`OPTIONAL`)
+
A link to a website for the resource, e.g. a landing page for a resource, i.e. a web-site that describes a corpus.

* one `<ed:Languages>` element (`REQUIRED`)
+
The (relevant) languages available within the resource. The `<ed:Languages>` element contains one or more `<ed:Language>` elements. The content of a `<ed:Language>` element `MUST` be a ISO 639-3 three letter language code. This element should be repeated for all languages (relevant) available _within_ the resource, however this list `MUST NOT` contain duplicate entries.

* one `<ed:AvailableDataViews>` element (`REQUIRED`)
+
The Data Views that are available for the resource. The `<ed:AvailableDataViews>` element `MUST` carry a `@ref` attribute that contains a whitespace-separated list of id values that correspond to value of the appropriate `@id` attribute for the `<ed:SupportedDataView>` elements that are referenced.
+
In case of sub-resources, each Resource `SHOULD` support all Data Views that are supported by the parent resource. However, every resource `MUST` declare all available Data Views independently, i.e. there is no implicit inheritance semantic.

* one `<ed:AvailableLayers>` element (`REQUIRED` if Endpoint supports _Advanced Search_ capability)
+ 
The `<ed:AvailableLayers>` element `MUST` carry a `@ref` attribute that contains a whitespace-separated list of id values that correspond to the value of the appropriate `@id` attribute for the `<ed:SupportedLayer>` elements that are referenced.
+
In case of sub-resources, each Resource `SHOULD` support all Layers that are supported by the parent resource. However, every resource `MUST` declare all available Layers independently, i.e. there is no implicit inheritance semantic.

* zero or one `<ed:Resources>` element (`OPTIONAL`)
+
If a resource has searchable sub-resources, the Endpoint `MUST` supply additional finer grained resource elements, which are wrapped in a `<ed:Resources>` element. A sub-resource is a searchable entity within a resource, e.g. a sub-corpus.

[#ed-simple,xml]
----
include::examples/endpoint-description-basic-search.xml[]
----

<<ed-simple,Example simple Endpoint Description>> shows a simple Endpoint Description for an Endpoint that only supports the _Basic Search_ Capability and only provides the Generic Hits Data View, which is indicated by a `<ed:SupportedDataView>` element. This element carries an `@id` attribute with a value of `hits`, the recommended value for the short identifier, and indicates a delivery policy of _send-by-default_ by the `@delivery-policy` attribute. It only provides one top-level resource identified by the persistent identifier `\http://hdl.handle.net/4711/0815`. The resource has a title as well as a description in German and English. A landing page is located at `\http://repos.example.org/corpus1.html`. The predominant language in the resource contents is German. Only the Generic Hits Data View is supported for this resource, because the `<ed:AvailableDataViews>` element only references the `<ed:SupporedDataView>` element with the `@id` with a value of hits.

The more complex <<ed-simple-cmdi,Example CMDI Endpoint Description>> show an Endpoint Description for an Endpoint that, similar to <<ed-simple,Example simple Endpoint Description>>, supports the _Basic Search_ capability. In addition to the Generic Hits Data View, it also supports the CMDI Data View. The delivery polices are _send-by-default_ for the Generic Hits Data View and _need-to-request_ for the CMDI Data View. The Endpoint has two top-level resources (identified by the persistent identifiers `\http://hdl.handle.net/4711/0815` and `\http://hdl.handle.net/4711/0816`. The second top-level resource has two independently searchable sub-resources, identified by the persistent identifier `\http://hdl.handle.net/4711/0816-1` and `\http://hdl.handle.net/4711/0816-2`. All resources are described using several properties, like title, description, etc. The first top-level resource provides only the Generic Hits Data View, while the other top-level resource including its children provide the Generic Hits and the CMDI Data Views.

.Example of Endpoint Description with _Advanced Search_ Capability
[#ed-adv,xml]
----
include::examples/endpoint-description-adv-search.xml[]
----

<<ed-adv,Example advanced Endpoint Description>> shows an Endpoint Description for an Endpoint that supports the _Advanced Search_ capability. The `<ed:SupportedDataViews>` also shows support for _Advanced Data View_ in this case. The `<ed:SupportedLayers>` contains the list of `<ed:SupportedLayer>` elements. These elements must carry an `@id` attribute that is referred to by an `<ed:Resource>` element to indicate which _Data View_ is supported and a `@result-id` attribute. The `@result-id` attribute is used in _ADV_. If needed the optional `@qualifier` attribute is used in a FCS-QL search term to address this specific layer, e.g. `pos` or `pos2`. The attribute `@alt-value-info` should contain a short description about the layer. If further information is needed use the `@alt-value-info-uri` attribute with an well-fomed URI to point to a web site. This information could be shown by the Aggregator together with any search results. The attribute `@type` has a default value of `value` which should only be changed to `empty` when needed.


== Searching

In the _Searching_ step the Client performs the actual search request to a previously <<Discovery,discovered>> Endpoint.


=== Basic Search

The _Basic Search_ capability provides simple full-text search. Queries in Basic Search `MUST` be performed in the _Contextual Query Language_ (<<ref:OASIS-CQL>>). The Endpoint `MUST` support _term-only_ queries. The Endpoint `SHOULD` support _terms_ combined with boolean operator queries (_AND_ and _OR_), including sub-queries. An Endpoint `MAY` also support _NOT_ or _PROX_ operator queries. If an Endpoint does not support a query, i.e. the used operators are not supported by the Endpoint, then it `MUST` return an appropriate error message using the appropriate SRU diagnostic (<<ref:LOC-DIAG>>).

The Endpoint `MUST` perform the query on an annotation layer that makes the most sense for the user, i.e. the textual content for a text corpus resource or the orthographic transcription of a spoken language corpus. Endpoints `SHOULD` perform the query case-sensitive.

.Examples of valid CQL queries for _Basic Search_
----
cat
"cat"
cat AND dog
"grumpy cat"
"grumpy cat" AND dog
"grumpy cat" OR "lazy dog"
cat AND (mouse OR "lazy dog")
----

NOTE: In CQL, a _term_ can be a single token or a phrase, i.e. tokens separated by spaces. If a single _term_ contains spaces, it needs to be quoted.

NOTE: Endpoints `MUST` be able to parse all of CQL. If they don't support a certain CQL feature, they `MUST` generate an appropriate error message (see section <<SRU/CQL>>). Especially, if an Endpoint _only_ supports _Basic Search_, it `MUST NOT` silently accept queries that include CQL features besides _term-only_ and terms combined with boolean operator queries, i.e. queries involving context sets, etc.


=== Advanced Search

The _Advanced Search_ capability allows searching in annotated data that is represented in annotation layers. An annotation layer contains annotations of a specific type, e.g. lemma or part-of-speech layer. Queries can be performed across annotation layer.

CLARIN-FCS defines a set of searchable annotation layers with certain semantics and syntax. Endpoints `SHOULD` support as many different, of course depending on the resource type, annotation layers as possible. 


==== Layers

Each Layer is assumed to be _segmented_, e.g. to allow for searching for a single lemma. However, CLARIN-FCS does not endorse a specific segmentation, i.e. the segmentation of Layers is in the domain of the Endpoint and _opaque_ to CLARIN-FCS. CLARIN-FCS *does not* endorse nor assume a _formal linguistic relation_ or _formal linguistic hierarchy_ between two items on two different layers.

The column _Layer Type Identifier_ denotes the identifier for a layer. It is used in <<FCS-QL>> queries and the XML serialization for the <<Advanced (ADV),Advanced Data View>>. All valid identifiers are defined in the table above, all other identifiers are reserved and `MUST NOT` be used. Clients and Endpoints `MAY` create custom Layer Type Identifiers, e.g. for testing proposed. If they do so, the custom Layer Type identifiers `MUST` start with the String `x-`, e.g. `x-customLayer`. The column _Syntax_ describes the inventory of symbols that a Client `MUST` use with a corresponding annotation layer; the value _String_ denotes that symbols are arbitrary Unicode Strings, i.e. no fixed inventory of symbols is defined. An Endpoint `SHOULD` provide an appropriate error, if a Client used an invalid value.


==== FCS-QL

Queries in _Advanced Search_ `MUST` be performed using _FCS-QL_ (<<FCS-QL EBNF,FCS-QL Grammar>>). The Endpoint `MUST` support parsing all of FCS-QL. If an Endpoint does not support a query, i.e. the used operators or layers are not supported by the Endpoint, it `MUST` return an appropriate error message using the appropriate SRU diagnostic (<<ref:LOC-DIAG>>). However, if the parameter `x-fcs-rewrites-allowed` is set to true, the Endpoint MAY rewrite the query with changed recall as a result.

The Endpoint `MUST` perform the query on the annotation layers that makes the most sense for the user, e.g. if no specific <<PartofSpeech>> layer is given with several layers available from the Discovery phase it should use the most generic one. Endpoints `SHOULD` perform the query with case sensitivity as specified in the query which by default is case sensitive.

.Examples of valid FCS-QL queries for _Advanced Search_

"Dog" /c

[z:pos = "ADJ"]

----

The qualifiers _z_ in _z:pos_ and _q_ in _q:pos_ `SHOULD` match an available qualifier attribute value in a _pos_-`SupportedLayer` in a discovered <<EndpointDescripion>>.

NOTE: Endpoints supporting _Advanced Search_ `MUST` be able to parse all of FCS-QL. If they don't support a certain FCS-QL feature, they `MUST` generate an appropriate error message (see section <<SRU/CQL>>). If an Endpoint _only_ supports _Basic Search_, it `MUST NOT` silently accept queries that include FCS-QL features.

NOTE: FCS-QL layer identifiers are reserved. The Endpoint `MUST` prepend the local prefix `x-` to any identifier used outside of the reserved set, e.g., `x-customLayer` for a local identifier `customLayer`. 


=== Result Format

The Search Engine will produce a result set containing several hits as the outcome of processing a query. The Endpoint `MUST` serialize these hits in the CLARIN-FCS result format. Endpoints are `REQUIRED` to adhere to the principle that _one_ hit `MUST` be serialized as _one_ CLARIN-FCS result record and `MUST NOT` combine several hits in one CLARIN-FCS result record. E.g., if a query matches five different sentences within one text (= the resource), the Endpoint must serialize them as five SRU records each with one Hit each referencing the same containing Resource (see section <<Operation _searchRetrieve_,Operation "searchRetrieve">>).

CLARIN-FCS uses a customized format for returning results. _Resource_ and _Resource Fragments_ serve as containers for hit results, which are presented in one or more _Data View_. The following section describes the Resource format and Data View format and section <<Operation _searchRetrieve_,Operation "searchRetrieve">> will describe how hits are embedded within SRU responses.


==== Resource and ResourceFragment

To encode search results, CLARIN-FCS supports two building blocks:

Resources::
    A _Resource_ is a _searchable_ and _addressable_ entity at the Endpoint, such as a text corpus or a multi-modal corpus. A resource `SHOULD` be a self-contained unit, i.e. not a single sentence in a text corpus or a time interval in an audio transcription, but rather a complete document from a text corpus or a complete audio transcription.

Resource Fragments::
    A _Resource Fragment_ is a smaller unit in a _Resource_, i.e. a sentence in a text corpus or a time interval in an audio transcription.

A Resource `SHOULD` be the most precise unit of data that is directly addressable as a "whole". A Resource `SHOULD` contain a Resource Fragment, if the hit consists of just a part of the Resource unit (for example if the hit is a sentence within a large text). A Resource Fragment `SHOULD` be addressable within a resource, i.e. it has an offset or a resource-internal identifier. Using Resource Fragments is `OPTIONAL`, but Endpoints are encouraged to use them. If the Endpoint encodes a hit with a Resource Fragment, the actual hit `SHOULD` be encoded as a Data View within the Resource Fragment.

Endpoints `SHOULD` always provide a link to the resource itself, i.e. each Resource or Resource Fragment` SHOULD` be identified by a persistent identifier or providing a URI that is unique for the Endpoint. Even if direct linking is not possible, i.e. due to licensing issues, the Endpoints `SHOULD` provide a URI to link to a web-page describing the corpus or collection, including instruction on how to obtain it. Endpoints `SHOULD` provide links that are as specific as possible (and logical), i.e. if a sentence within a resource cannot be addressed directly, the Resource Fragment `SHOULD NOT` contain a persistent identifier or an URI.

If the Endpoint can provide both, a persistent identifier as well as a URI, for either Resource or Resource Fragment, then they `SHOULD` provide both. When working with results, Clients `SHOULD` prefer persistent identifiers over regular URIs.

Resource and Resource Fragment are serialized in XML and Endpoints `MUST` generate responses that are valid according to the XML schema link:attachments/Resource.xsd["Resource.xsd"]. A _Resource_ is encoded in the form of a `<fcs:Resource>` element, a _Resource Fragment_ in the form of a `<fcs:ResourceFragment>` element. The content of a Data View is wrapped in a `<fcs:DataView>` element. `<fcs:Resource>` is the top-level element and `MAY` contain zero or more `<fcs:DataView>` elements and MAY contain zero or more `<fcs:ResourceFragment>` elements. A `<fcs:ResourceFragment>` element MUST contain one or more `<fcs:DataView>` elements.

The elements `<fcs:Resource>`, `<fcs:ResourceFragment>` and `<fcs:DataView>` `MAY` carry a `@pid` and/or a `@ref` attribute, which allows linking to the original data represented by the Resource, Resource Fragment, or Data View. A `@pid` attribute `MUST` contain a valid persistent identifier, a `@ref` `MUST` contain valid URI, i.e. a "plain" URI without the additional semantics of being a persistent reference. If the Endpoint cannot provide a `@pid` attribute for a `<fcs:Resource>`, they `SHOULD` provide a @ref attribute. Endpoint `SHOULD` add either a `@pid` or `@ref` attribute to either the `<fcs:Resource>` or the `<fcs:ResourceFragment>` element, if possible to both elements. Endpoints are `RECOMMENDED` to give `@pid` attributes, if they can provide them.

Endpoints `MUST` use the identifier `\http://clarin.eu/fcs/resource` for the _responseItemType_ (= content for the `<sru:recordSchema>` element) in SRU responses.

Endpoints `MAY` serialize hits as multiple Data Views, however they `MUST` provide the Generic Hits (HITS) Data View either encoded as a Resource Fragment (if applicable), or otherwise within the Resource (if there is no reasonable Resource Fragment). Other Data Views `SHOULD` be put in a place that is logical for their content (as is to be determined by the Endpoint), e.g. a metadata Data View would most likely be put directly below Resource and a Data View representing some annotation layers directly around the hit is more likely to belong within a Resource Fragment.

.Example of _Generic Hits_ embedded in _Resource_
[#gh-dv-resource,xml]
----
include::examples/generic-hits-dv-in-resource.xml[]
----

<<gh-dv-resource>> shows a simple hit, which is encoded in one Data View of type _Generic Hits_ embedded within a Resource. The type of the Data View is identified by the MIME type `application/x-clarin-fcs-hits+xml`. The Resource is referenceable by the persistent identifier `\http://hdl.handle.net/4711/08-15`.

.Example of _Generic Hits_ embedded in _Resource Fragment_
[#gh-dv-resource-fragment,xml]
----
include::examples/generic-hits-dv-in-resource-fragment.xml[]
----

<<gh-dv-resource-fragment>> shows a hit encoded as a Resource Fragment embedded within a Resource. The actual hit is again encoded as one Data View of type _Generic Hits_. The hit is not directly referenceable, but the Resource, in which the hit occurred, is referenceable by the persistent identifier `\http://hdl.handle.net/4711/08-15`. In contrast to <<gh-dv-resource>>, the Endpoint decided to provide a "semantically richer" encoding and embedded the hit using a Resource Fragment within the Resource to indicate that the hit is a part of a larger resource, e.g. a sentence in a text document.

.Example of _Generic Hits_ embedded in _Resource Fragment_ with CMDI Data View
[#gh-dv-cmdi-resource,xml]
----
include::examples/generic-hits-dv-in-resource-with-cmdi.xml[]
----

The more complex <<gh-dv-cmdi-resource>> is similar to <<gh-dv-resource-fragment>>, i.e. it shows a hit is encoded as one _Generic Hits_ Data View in a Resource Fragment, which is embedded in a Resource. In contrast to <<gh-dv-resource-fragment>>, another Data View of type CMDI is embedded directly within the Resource. The Endpoint can use this type of Data View to directly provide CMDI metadata about the Resource to Clients. All entities of the Hit can be referenced by a persistent identifier and a URI. The complete Resource is referenceable by either the persistent identifier `\http://hdl.handle.net/4711/08-15` or the URI `\http://repos.example.org/file/text_08_15.html` and the CMDI metadata record in the CMDI Data View is referenceable either by the persistent identifier `\http://hdl.handle.net/4711/08-15-1` or the URI `\http://repos.example.org/file/08_15_1.cmdi`. The actual hit in the Resource Fragment is also directly referenceable by either the persistent identifier `\http://hdl.handle.net/4711/00-15-2` or the URI `\http://repos.example.org/file/text_08_15.html#sentence2`.


==== Data View

A _Data View_ serves as a container for encoding the actual search results (the data fragments relevant to search) within CLARIN-FCS. Data Views are designed to allow for different representations of results, i.e. they are deliberately kept open to allow further extensions with more supported Data View formats. This specification only defines a _most basic_ Data View for representing search results, called _Generic Hits_ (see below). More Data Views are defined in the supplementary specification <<ref:CLARIN-FCS-DataViews>>.

The content of a Data View is called _Payload_. Each Payload is typed and the type of the Payload is recorded in the `@type` attribute of the `<fcs:DataView>` element. The Payload type is identified by a MIME type (<<ref:RFC6838>>, <<ref:RFC3023>>). If no existing MIME type can be used, implementers `SHOULD` define a proper private mime type.

The Payload of a Data View can either be deposited _inline_ or by _reference_. In the case of _inline_, it `MUST` be serialized as an XML fragment below the `<fcs:DataView>` element. This is the preferred method for payloads that can easily be serialized in XML. Deposition by _reference_ is meant for content that cannot easily be deposited inline, i.e. binary content (like images). In this case, the Data View `MUST` include a `@ref` or `@pid` attribute that links location for Clients to download the payload. This location `SHOULD` be _openly accessible_, i.e. data can be downloaded freely without any need to perform a login.

Data Views are classified into a _send-by-default_ and a _need-to-request_ delivery policy. In case of the _send-by-default_ delivery policy, the Endpoint `MUST` send the Data View automatically, i.e. Endpoints `MUST` unconditionally include the Data View when they serialize a response to a search request. In the case of _need-to-request_, the Client must explicitly request the Endpoint to include this Data View in the response. This enables the Endpoint to not generate and serialize Data Views that are "expensive" in terms of computational power or bandwidth for every response. To request such a Data View, a Client `MUST` submit a comma separated list of Data View identifiers (see section <<Endpoint Description>>) in the `x-fcs-dataviews` extra request parameter with the _searchRetrieve_ request. If a Client requests a Data View that is not valid for the search context, the Endpoint `MUST` generate a non-fatal diagnostic `\http://clarin.eu/fcs/diagnostic/4` ("Requested Data View not valid for this resource"). The details field of the diagnostic `MUST` contain the MIME type of the Data View that was not valid. If more than one requested Data View is invalid, the Endpoint `MUST` generate a _separate_ non-fatal diagnostic `\http://clarin.eu/fcs/diagnostic/4` for each of the requested Data Views.

The description of every Data View contains a recommendation as to how the Endpoint should handle the payload delivery, i.e. if a Data View is by default considered _send-by-default_ or _need-to-request_. Endpoint `MAY` choose to implement different policy. The relevant information which policy is implemented by an Endpoint for a specific Data View is part of the _Endpoint Description_ (see section <<Endpoint Description>>). For each Data View, a _Recommended Short Identifier_ is defined that Endpoint `SHOULD` use for an identifier of the Data View in the list of supported Data Views in the _Endpoint Description_.

The _Generic Hits_ Data View is mandatory, thus all Endpoints `MUST` implement it and provide search results represented in the _Generic Hits_ Data View. Endpoints `MUST` implement the _Generic Hits_ Data View with the _send-by-default_ delivery policy.

NOTE: The examples in the following sections _show only_ the payload with the enclosing `<fcs:DataView>` element of a Data View. Of course, the Data View must be embedded either in a `<fcs:Resource>` or a `<fcs:ResourceFragment>` element. The `@pid` and `@ref` attributes have been omitted for all _inline_ payload types.

The _Generic Hits_ Data View serves as the _most basic_ agreement in CLARIN-FCS for serialization of search results and `MUST` be implemented by all Endpoints. In many cases, this Data View can only serve as an (lossy) approximation, because resources at Endpoints are very heterogeneous. For instance, the Generic Hits Data View is probably not the best representation for a hit result in a corpus of spoken language, but an architecture like CLARIN-FCS requires one common representation to be implemented by all Endpoints, therefore this Data View was defined. The Generic Hits Data View supports multiple markers for supplying highlighting for an individual hit, e.g. if a query contains a (boolean) conjunction, the Endpoint can use multiple markers to provide individual highlights for the matching terms. An Endpoint `MUST NOT` use this Data View to aggregate several hits within one resource. Each hit `SHOULD` be presented within the context of a complete sentence. If that is not possible due to the nature of the type of the resource, the Endpoint `MUST` provide an equivalent reasonable unit of context (e.g. within a phrase of an orthographic transcription of an utterance). The `<hits:Hit>` element within the `<hits:Result>` element is not enforced by the XML schema, but Endpoints are `RECOMMENDED` to use it. The XML fragment of the Generic Hits payload `MUST` be valid according to the XML schema link:attachments/DataView-Hits.xsd["DataView-Hits.xsd"].

The _Advanced (ADV)_ Data View serves as the natural serialization of search results for _Advanced Search_ queries. The ADV Data View supports structured information in one or more annotation layers. The annotations are streams (ranges) over the signal in a stand-off like format with start and end offsets. The list of `<Segment>` elements building a stream can be of type `item` for character-based streams or `timestamp` for audio streams (granularity up to 0.001s). The Endpoint is responsible for choosing the proper offsets for the segments. The segments `MUST` be possible to align over all annotation layers. For character streams the recommendation is Unicode Normalization Form _KC_. Segments `MAY` also have an endpoint specific reference indicated by an URI that could be shown in the Aggregator, e.g. to open an audio player or other viewer with contents from the Search Engine. The list of `<Layer>` elements contains `<Span>` elements making references to the segments. A `<Span>` inherits the start and end offsets from its segments and contains the actual annotation as its content. It `MAY` also carry information about the original annotation value in an `@alt-value` attribute. The document order of the `<Layer>` elements define the view order in the Aggregator. Each Layer has a _Layer type identifier_ and a _Layer identifier_. The Endpoint `SHOULD` at least return all layers that were referenced in the Advanced Search query. It `MAY` return more layers. The attribute `@highlight` is used to mark Spans as hits. Multiple hit markers are supported and the Aggregator `MAY` display them visually distinct. It is up to the Endpoint to decide what should be marked as a hit, but the recommendation is to mark everything referenced in the Advanced Search query.

=== Versioning and Extensions

==== Backwards Compatibility

Clients `MUST` be compatible to CLARIN-FCS 1.0, thus `MUST` implement SRU 1.2. If a Client uses CLARIN-FCS 1.0 to talk to an Endpoint, it `MUST NOT` use features beyond the Basic Search capability. Clients `MUST` implement a heuristic to automatically determine which CLARIN-FCS protocol version, i.e. which version of the SRU protocol, can be used talk an Endpoint.

Clients `MUST` be able to process the legacy XML namespaces:

* `\http://www.loc.gov/zing/srw/` for SRU response documents, and
* `\http://www.loc.gov/zing/srw/diagnostic/` for diagnostics within SRU response documents.

which SRU 1.2 Endpoints use for serializing responses as well as the OASIS XML namespaces. CLARIN-FCS deviates from the OASIS specification <<ref:OASIS-SRU-Overview>> and <<ref:OASIS-SRU12>> to ensure backwards comparability with SRU 1.2 services as they were defined by the <<ref:LOC-SRU12>>.

Pseudo algorithm for version detection heuristic:

* Send _explain_ request without `version` and `operation` parameter.
* Check SRU response for content of the element `<sru:explainResponse>/<sru:version>`.


==== Endpoint Custom Extensions

Endpoints can add custom extensions, i.e. custom data, to the Result Format. This extension mechanism can for example be used to provide hints for an (XSLT/XQuery) application that works directly on CLARIN-FCS, e.g. to allow it to generate back and forward links to navigate in a result set.

An Endpoint `MAY` add arbitrary XML fragments to the extension hooks provided in the `<fcs:Resource>` element (see the XML schema for link:attachments/Resource.xsd["Resource.xsd"]). The XML fragment for the extension `MUST` use a custom XML namespace name for the extension. Endpoints `MUST NOT` use XML namespace names that start with the prefixes `\http://clarin.eu`, `\http://www.clarin.eu/`, `\https://clarin.eu` or `\https://www.clarin.eu/`.

A Client `MUST` ignore any custom extensions it does not understand and skip over these XML fragments when parsing the Endpoint's response.

The non-normative appendix contains an <<Endpoint custom extensions,example>>, how an extension could be implemented.
