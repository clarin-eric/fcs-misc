== List of extra request parameters

The following extra request parameters are used in CLARIN-FCS. The column _SRU operations_ lists the SRU operation, for which this extra request parameter is to be used. Clients `MUST NOT` use the parameter for an operation that is not listed in this column. However, if a Client sends an invalid parameter, an Endpoint `SHOULD` issue a fatal diagnostic "Unsupported Parameter" (`info:srw/diagnostic/1/8`) and stop processing the request. Alternatively, an Endpoint `MAY` silently ignore the invalid parameter.

== List of diagnostics

Apart from the SRU diagnostics defined in <<ref:OASIS-SRU12,OASIS-SRU12, Appendix C>> and <<ref:LOC-DIAG>>, the following diagnostics are used in CLARIN-FCS. The "Details Format" column specifies what `SHOULD` be returned in the details field. If this column is blank, the format is "undefined" and the Endpoint `MAY` return whatever it feels appropriate, including nothing.
